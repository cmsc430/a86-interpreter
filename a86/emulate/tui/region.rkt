;;
;; REGION DEFINITION
;;
;; "Regions" are rectangular sections of the terminal that have their own
;; distinct behavior. Regions are similar to "windows" in emacs parlance, if we
;; take the entire text-based user interface to be a "frame" in the same
;; vocabulary. This syntax macro enables easy definition of regions with
;; encapsulated data and behavior.
;;
;; Region definitions work a lot like class definitions. Regions can have fields
;; and methods (collectively called the "elements"), which have implicit access
;; to the region itself as well as all the other elements. This allows for
;; easily writing functions with shared data, which can be immensely beneficial
;; in implementing a user interface.
;;
;; NOTE: Although there are similarities to classes, there are many
;; distinctions. One important distinction is that all fields and methods of a
;; region are "public" in the sense that they will be accessible outside the
;; region.
;;
;; TODO: Is it worth adding a notion of "private" fields and methods? It could
;; be done like Python's, i.e., by using a special prefix or suffix in the
;; identifiers themselves. For now I think this is not important, but maybe we
;; can revisit it later.
;;
;; The syntax of region definitions is:
;;
;;     (define-region
;;       region-id
;;       #:width-spec width
;;       #:height-spec height
;;       [(define-pre-init (param ...) body ...+)]
;;       [(define-post-init (param ...) body ...+)]
;;       (define-field field-id [body]) ...
;;       (define-method (method-id param ...) body ...+) ...)
;;
;;     region-id, param, field-id, method-id :: identifier
;;     width, height                         :: size-spec*
;;
;;     *The size-spec is explained further below.
;;
;; (Note that, except for the [region-id], the forms may be given in any order.)
;;
;; Region methods do not support advanced parameter binding. In other words,
;; only simple identifiers are allowed as [param]s. Within the [body]s, methods
;; can be called like regular functions using their defined names, e.g.,
;; [(method-id arg ...)].
;;
;; Fields can be defined uninitialized by simply not specifying a value. Such
;; fields must be initialized by the end of the initialization sequence. This
;; can be done by using the [define-pre-init] or [define-post-init] forms.
;;
;; The [body]s of the pre-initializer function (which is optional) will be
;; evaluated before any [region?] is initialized at all, meaning that you
;; probably don't want to refer to [this-region] within those [body]s. But maybe
;; you do, I don't know.
;;
;; The [body]s of the post-initializer function (which is optional) will be
;; evaluated after the [region?] has been initialized and the (initialized)
;; fields and methods have been set. It is guaranteed that [this-region] will be
;; properly set by this point.
;;
;; Within the [body]s, fields can be modified via regular [set!] syntax. For
;; example, one might perform [(set! answer 42)] to set the field named [answer]
;; within the current region to the value [42].
;;
;; After evaluation of the [define-region] form, a number of identifiers will
;; become available in the surrounding context:
;;
;;     region-id:initialize!
;;     region-id:field-id ...
;;     region-id:methood-id ...
;;
;;
;; SPECIAL SYNTAX
;;
;; Within any [body], the syntax [this-region] will refer to the region's value,
;; which is a [region?]. Additionally, [this-region:coords] will be bound to a
;; list consisting of the coordinates of [this-region] in the same form as those
;; produced by [region-coords]. Lastly, [this-region:size] will be bound to a
;; pair of the width and height of the region.
;;
;; The [body]s of fields and methods can refer to any of the [field-id]s or
;; [method-id]s directly. The [field-id]s must be used as identifiers, while the
;; [method-id]s must be called as functions with the appropriate quantity of
;; arguments. The fields can be updated by using regular [set!] syntax, e.g.,
;; [(set! field-id new-value)] will replace the current value of [field-id] with
;; [new-value]. NOTE: The [new-value] expression will be evaluated prior to
;; setting the value in place, allowing you to reference a field recursively
;; without an infinite loop.
;;
;;
;; SIZE SPECIFICATIONS (SIZE-SPEC)
;;
;; Regions support a somewhat complex grammar for defining what size they ought
;; to try to be. These size specifications are used during the search for an
;; empty space on the screen during initialization.
;;
;; The grammar for size specifications is as follows:
;;
;;     size      ::= percentage?
;;                |  exact-positive-integer?
;;                |  (range size-expr size-expr)
;;                |  size-expr
;;
;;     size-expr ::= (percentage? size-expr)
;;                |  (math-op size-expr)
;;                |  size-atom
;;
;;     size-atom ::= exact-positive-integer?
;;                |  (sizeof region-id)
;;                |  avail | available
;;                |  full | total | max
;;
;;     math-op   ::= + | - | * | /
;;
;; Some size specification examples, explained:
;;
;;     37           Exactly 37 terminal-pixels.
;;
;;     25%          Converted to [(25% total)].
;;
;;     avail        Bound during each iteration of the space search to the
;;     available    number of terminal-pixels available along this axis.
;;
;;     full         Bound during the space search to the size of the terminal
;;     total        along this axis. This number is fixed for each search (i.e.,
;;     max          it is not re-evaluated during each iteration).
;;
;;     (p% s)       Converted to [(* (p / 100) s)].
;;
;;     (range a b)  Finds a space at least [a] terminal-pixels in size, but up
;;                  to [b] terminal-pixels.
;;
;;                  NOTE: This range is inclusive, unlike Racket's [range].
;;
;;     (sizeof r)   Evaluates to the size of the region [r] along the same axis.
;;
;;                  NOTE: If the region [r] is not initialized, this will result
;;                  in an error.
;;
;;
;; INITIALIZATION
;;
;; The [region-id:initialize!] function triggers the initialization sequence,
;; the steps of which are detailed below. The function is invoked with _n_ + _m_
;; arguments, where _n_ is the number of parameters defined in [define-pre-init]
;; and _m_ is the number of parameters defined in [define-post-init]. The
;; pre-init and post-init parameter names are prefixed internally to avoid
;; collisions. The first _n_ arguments to [region-id:initialize!] will be passed
;; to the pre-init [body]s, while the last _m_ arguments will be passed to the
;; post-init [body]s.
;;
;; The initialization sequence works like this:
;;
;;   0. The internal region identifier is bound to [#f], meaning [this-region]
;;      will produce [#f] for now.
;;   1. The pre-init [body]s are evaluated. Note that references to
;;      uninitialized fields at this point will produce errors.
;;   2. The main initialization sequence takes place, which consists of a number
;;      of sub-steps.
;;
;;        a. The current screen size is obtained from [term:screen-size].
;;        b. A number of columns and rows is determined by converting the given
;;           size specifications ([width] and [height]) within the context of
;;           the now-determined screen size.
;;        c. The screen is searched for an empty rectangle meeting the derived
;;           specifications. If no such space can be found, an error is raised.
;;        d. The internal [region?] is initialized with these derived
;;           specifications, and is installed into the region state via
;;           [regions:install].
;;
;;   3. The post-init [body]s are evaluated.
;;   4. Fields defined without an initial value are checked. If any are found to
;;      still be without a value, an error is raised.
;;
;; Within any of the initialization [body] forms, all of the field and method
;; names will be bound. Note that accessing the value of an uninitialized field
;; results in an error. The region itself ([this-region]) will be [#f] until
;; after the main initialization step (2d).
;;
;;
;; EXTERNAL IDENTIFIERS
;;
;; After defining a region with [define-region] and initializing it with the
;; [region-id:initialize!] function, the elements become accessible via prefixed
;; forms of their internal names. For example, a method named [fly-hovercar]
;; within a region named [my-region] will be available externally as
;; [my-region:fly-hovercar]. Fields are still accessed as bare identifiers, and
;; methods are called as normal functions which implicitly have access to
;; [this-region].
;;
;; Sometimes, it may be desirable to dynamically refer to elements of a region.
;; For example, if you have a set of regions that you have implemented with a
;; similar interface (e.g., they all have a method [count-eels]), you may want
;; to call all of the regions' same-named methods. This is not possible using
;; the prefixed identifier forms, but it _is_ possible via [get] and [call]. For
;; this example, you might do:
;;
;;     (for ([r list-of-regions])
;;       (call r 'count-eels))
;;
;; In fact, the prefixed identifier forms are syntactic sugar for this process.

;;

;; indicated size (because it is too small).

;; Size specifications can make use of the special syntax [available] and
;; [total]. The [available] identifier is parameterized with the current amount
;; of empty terminal-pixels along the axis of the current dimension. The [total]
;; identifier is parameterized with the size of the screen in the current

;; with their bare names, but these names are obfuscated externally by prefixing
;; them with the region's name. So, for example, the [refresh] method would be
;; invoked externally via a call like [(my-region:refresh 1 1 4 5)].
;;
;; Within the context of any of the fields or methods, the special syntax
;; [this-region] is available, and it refers to the [region?] corresponding to
;; the current region.
;;
;; Methods are also available dynamically through a [send-region] mechanism. The
;; region contains a [hash?] mapping method and field names to their functions
;; such that [(send-region my-region 'method-id arg1 arg2)] corresponds to
;; [(my-region:method-name arg1 arg2)]. This is useful for dispatching the same
;; arguments to similar methods defined in multiple regions (e.g., invoking a
;; refreshing method for all regions to update the screen).
;;
;; TODO: I think this can be encapsulated in a module that is then automatically
;; [require]d from. That might be easier than trying to wrap it all in a
;; function or something.

         ;; 1. Rewrite [region?] struct definition with dispatch capabilities.
         ;;
         ;;     I think we can model this through a simple symbol-based hash
         ;;     lookup functionality. The behavior for fields will need to be
         ;;     considered, but for methods it could be something like:
         ;;
         ;;         (call the-region 'method-id args ...)
         ;;
         ;;     Which translates into a lookup of ['method-id] within the method
         ;;     hash, acquiring an anonymous function (?), and then calling that
         ;;     function with the args. Within the scope of the method body, some
         ;;     syntactic forms may be [syntax-parameterize]d, such as
         ;;     [this-region] so they don't have to be passed in as arguments.
         ;;
         ;;     Field lookup is similar but perhaps a bit different. I guess we
         ;;     could do:
         ;;
         ;;         (access the-region 'field-id)
         ;;
         ;;     This would look up the value in the (mutable) hash.
         ;;
         ;; 2. Provide internal syntax for referring to the region's elements.
         ;;
         ;;     Within method bodies (and fields? unsure), the other elements of
         ;;     the region should be accessible without being written as a symbol,
         ;;     and without any special prefix. For example:
         ;;
         ;;         (define-method (add-coords)
         ;;           (sum (region-coords this-region)))
         ;;         (define-method (do-thing)
         ;;           (add1 (add-coords)))
         ;;
         ;;     Note that the [do-thing] method refers to the [add-coords] method
         ;;     by name. Similarly, the [add-coords] method is able to refer to
         ;;     [this-region].
         ;;
         ;; 3. Provide external bindings for the region's elements.
         ;;
         ;;     Within any scope where the region is defined, the fields and
         ;;     methods should still be accessible. Instead of requiring the
         ;;     lengthy syntax from (1), we can instead provide a prefixed binding
         ;;     for each of the elements:
         ;;
         ;;         (call the-region 'method-id args ...)
         ;;
         ;;     becomes
         ;;
         ;;         (the-region:method-name args ...)
         ;;
         ;;
         ;;
         ;; IMPLEMENTATION
         ;;
         ;; The implementation of this system requires a few things. First, the
         ;; region struct needs to be redefined to have a hash for mapping the
         ;; element names to their values. The new [region] struct will have:
         ;;
         ;;     name
         ;;     from-x from-y to-x to-y
         ;;     num-cols num-rows
         ;;     elements-hash
         ;;
         ;; NOTE: The keymap has been removed. I think this actually should only
         ;; exist at the top level, and the top level will be responsible for
         ;; calling the various methods as needed. This is less modular, but this
         ;; isn't meant to be a perfectly modular system.
         ;;
         ;; After revising the region struct, the [define-region] macro needs to
         ;; be implemented.
