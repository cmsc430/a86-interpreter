;; Memory Representation
;;
;; We adopt some arbitrary conventions to simulate (in some sense) the typical
;; memory schema seen in x86-64 machines. This module provides an API through
;; which this representation can be built and used.
;;
;; The memory layout looks like this:
;;
;; #xfffffffffffffff8  +----------------+
;;                     |XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|
;;                     |XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|

;;                     |                |

;;
;; Some addresses are rendered inaccessible to simulate kernel space or other
;; regions of memory that do not belong to the running program.
;;
;; The Text, Rodata, Data, and BSS sections are initialized to exactly as much
;; space as they need to store the program instructions, the read-only static
;; data, the initialized writable static data, and the uninitialized writable
;; static data, respectively.
;;
;; The Heap and Stack sections are initialized with zeroes. The Heap grows
;; upwards from the top of the last static section, and the Stack grows
;; downwards from the highest allowed address.
;;
;; Although x86 memory is byte-addressable, our simulation only handles words.
;; It is recommended that clients of this API align addresses to words to ensure
;; proper function.

(module sections racket
  ;; A section is a light wrapper around a vector. Sections have a maximum size,
  ;; but their internal vectors can be smaller than that. Writes to indices
  ;; outside the bounds of the internal vector but within the maximum size
  ;; result in a resizing of the internal vector.
  ;;
  ;; Sections also handle logic related to the specific internal memory model we
  ;; adapt for the interpreter. Specifically, we want interpreter memory to have
  ;; memory itself, i.e., we would like to be able to search backward through
  ;; the write history of an address to aid in debugging. To support this,
  ;; insertions into sections record an interpreter time-tick associated with
  ;; the write. A given memory address will have record of its past writes and
  ;; their time ticks.
  ;;
  ;; However, storing arbitrarily many such time tick/value pairs could pose a
  ;; problem of efficiency. Sectors therefore support three different memory
  ;; handling strategies to address this:
  ;;
  ;;   limited    each address in writable memory can be written to only so many
  ;;              times, after which an error is raised
  ;;
  ;;   rotating   each address in writable memory can be written to only so many
  ;;              times, after which the oldest values are dropped in favor of
  ;;              keeping the newer values
  ;;
  ;;   unlimited  no bound on the amount of times a specific address can be
  ;;              written to
  ;;
  ;; The default handling strategy is [rotating], with a default maximum memory
  ;; depth of [10] cells.
