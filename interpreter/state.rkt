;;   instruction-pointer:
;;       The address of the next instruction to execute.
;;
;;   labels:
;;       An association list mapping label names to addresses.
;;
;;   registers:
;;       A hash mapping register names to their values.
;;
;;   flags:
;;       A hash mapping flag names to their values.
;;
;;   memory:
;;       A [Memory] object from ["memory.rkt"], representing the current stack.

;; TODO: Remove transparency?
;; TODO: Revise implementations of recording devices for consistency? Currently,
;; the registers and flags are meant to be updated functionally while the
