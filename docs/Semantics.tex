\section{Semantics (Informal)}

Before formalizing our semantics, we provide an informal specification. These
definitions are based on existing documentation and code. A formal semantics is
presented in the next section.

\subsection{Program}

First, we define a \emph{program}. A program is a list of instructions, where:

\begin{itemize}
\item The list is not empty.
\item The first instruction is a \term{Label}, which will be used as the entry
  point of the program (i.e., it is where execution begins).
\item Two \term{Label} instructions in the same program cannot use the same
  label name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Registers}

There are sixteen 64-bit registers, each corresponding to one of the names in
\nonterm{r64}. The special register reference \term{eax} refers to the lower 32
bits of the \term{rax} register.

\subsection{Flags}

There are four single-bit registers, called \emph{flags}, each corresponding to
one of the names in \nonterm{f}. The flags are used for arithmetic and
comparison operations:

{\renewcommand\labelitemii{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \term{OF} --- Overflow Flag

    Set when\ldots
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \ldots\emph{adding} two numbers with the same sign bit and the result
      has a different sign bit.
    \item \ldots\emph{subtracting} a negative number from a positive number and
      the result is negative.
    \item \ldots\emph{subtracting} a positive number from a negative number and
      the result is positive.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \term{SF} --- Sign Flag

    Set to the value of the sign bit of the result.
  \item \term{ZF} --- Zero Flag

    Set if the computed result is exactly \texttt{0}.
  \item \term{CF} --- Carry Flag

    Set if the (unsigned) arithmetic operation required an extra bit.
    % TODO: Do we even use CF? I think we might be able to leave it out.
  \end{itemize}

}

\noindent We say a flag ``is set'' if the value \texttt{1} is stored in it, or
the flag ``is clear'' or ``is unset'' if the value \texttt{0} is stored in it
instead. We may also use these terms as verbs, i.e., ``to set'' a flag means to
store \texttt{1} in it and so on. Note, however, that ``set'' is overloaded as a
verb, since it can also be used to indicate storing a specific value (e.g.,
``the flag is set to the value of <some computation>'').

\subsection{Memory}

All \lang{} programs also run with some limited amount of register-external
memory called the \emph{stack}. The stack starts at the highest available
address space and ``grows downwards'', which means that adding something to the
stack \emph{decrements} the pointer to the current position in the stack.

\subsection{Instructions}

There are 20 supported instructions in \lang{}, which work as follows:

{\renewcommand\labelitemii{}\renewcommand\labelitemiii{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Label l} creates a new label named \texttt{l} that points to the
    next instruction.
  \item \texttt{Ret} pops an address from the stack and jumps to it.
  \item \texttt{Call dst} pushes the return address onto the stack, then jumps
    to the address indicated by the label or register in \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Mov dst src} moves the contents of/value at \texttt{src} into
    \texttt{dst}.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item NOTE: Either \texttt{dst} or \texttt{src} may be an offset, but not
      both.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Add dst src} adds \texttt{src} to \texttt{dst} and writes the
    result to \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Sub dst src} subtracts \texttt{src} from \texttt{dst} and writes
    the result to \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Cmp a1 a2} compares \texttt{a1} to \texttt{a2} by subtracting
    the former from the latter and sets the flags according to the result:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{CF} is set if an extra bit was needed to complete the
      computation.
    \item \texttt{ZF} is set if \texttt{a2 - a1} $=$ \texttt{0}.
    \item \texttt{SF} is set if \texttt{a2 - a1} $<$ \texttt{0}.
    \item \texttt{OF} is set if either\ldots
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \ldots\texttt{a1} is negative, \texttt{a2} is positive, and
        \texttt{a2 - a1} $<$ \texttt{0}.
      \item \ldots\texttt{a1} is positive, \texttt{a2} is negative, and
        \texttt{a2 - a1} $>$ \texttt{0}.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Jmp dst} jumps to the address at \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Je dst} jumps to the address at \texttt{dst} if \texttt{ZF} is
    set.
  \item \texttt{Jne dst} jumps to the address at \texttt{dst} if \texttt{ZF} is
    \emph{not} set.
  \item \texttt{Jl dst} jumps to the address at \texttt{dst} if \texttt{SF} and
    \texttt{OF} have different values.
  \item \texttt{Jg dst} jumps to the address at \texttt{dst} if \texttt{SF} and
    \texttt{OF} are set to the same value and \texttt{ZF} is unset.
  \item \texttt{And dst src} computes the bitwise AND (\texttt{\&{}}) of the
    operands and stores the result in \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Or dst src} computes the bitwise OR (\texttt{|}) of the operands
    and stores the result in \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Xor dst src} computes the bitwise XOR (\texttt{\^{}}) of the
    operands and stores the result in \texttt{dst}.
  \item \texttt{Sal dst i} arithmetically shifts the bits in \texttt{dst} to the
    left by \texttt{i} bits and stores the result in \texttt{dst}. The new bits
    from the right are \texttt{0}s, and the \texttt{CF} flag is updated to the
    value of the most-significant bit during each shift.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item NOTE: If \texttt{i} is \texttt{1}, the \texttt{OF} flag is cleared if
      the most-significant bit of the result is the same as the \texttt{CF}
      flag. Otherwise, it is set.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Sar dst src} arithmetically shifts the bits in \texttt{dst} to
    the right by \texttt{i} bits and stores the result in \texttt{dst}. The new
    bits from the left are duplicated from the original most-significant bit,
    and the \texttt{CF} flag is updated to the value of the least-significant
    bit during each shift.
    \begin{itemize}
      % TODO: Do this need to be specified? Probably can just remove it...
    \item NOTE: The \texttt{OF} flag is always cleared.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Push src} decrements the stack pointer and stores the
    \texttt{src} operands on the top of the stack.
  \item \texttt{Pop dst} loads the value from the top of the stack into the
    \texttt{dst} operand and increments the stack pointer.
  \item \texttt{Lea dst l} loads the address of the label \texttt{l} and stores
    it in \texttt{dst}.
  \end{itemize}
